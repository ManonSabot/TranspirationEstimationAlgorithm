# TranspirationEstimationAlgorithm
A method of estimating transpiration directly from carbon, water, and energy fluxes, such as eddy covariance datasets.

## Installation

Requirements:
- numpy
- scipy
- xarray
- scikit-learn

Can be installed via anaconda:

conda install -c jnelson18 transpiration_estimation_algorithm

For an overview of how to run the algorithm, please see the tutorial.ipynb

Additionally the ipynb can be run interactively:
- open a terminal
- download both the tutorial.ipynb and TestData into the same directory
- with jupyter installed (conda install jupyter) run:

    jupyter notebook tutorial.ipynb
